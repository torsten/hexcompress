# Hexcompress

Hexcompress is good to compress short-ish ASCII strings
that contain many numbers or hex-encoded bytes.

For example the string "ffaa12" (7 bytes) will compress to "\xff\xaa\x12" (4) thats 50% compression!

Hexcompress is currently released via [Clojars](https://clojars.org/hexcompress). The latest release is `0.0.1`.  I am not yet sure if it is useful.
