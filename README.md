Hexcompress **is not a generic compression algorithm**.

Instead, hexcompress is very good at compressing short-ish (~ 1-500 characters) ASCII **strings that contain many numbers** or hex-encoded bytes.

For example the string `"caffeebabe"` (10&nbsp;bytes) will compress to `"\xCA\xFF\xEE\xBA\xBE"` (5&nbsp;bytes), that's 50% compression!

Mixed strings are encoded like so: `"eat more beef!!1111"` (19&nbsp;bytes) will become `"\xEAt more \xBE\xEF!!\x11\x11"` (14&nbsp;bytes), that's 26% compression.

Since printable ASCII characters are preserved as is, that means **0% worst-case compression** when no hex-numbers are present, at least your data won't get any bigger!

Currently, compression is optional. Uncompressing the data `"1337"` will just decompress to the string `"1337"` which makes it easy to integrate with new code that may or may not compress yet. (This fact may change in the future)


## Libraries

The Clojure version of hexcompress is currently released via [Clojars](https://clojars.org/io.torsten/hexcompress). The latest release is `0.0.3`:

```clojure
[io.torsten/hexcompress "0.0.3"]
```

The Javascript version is in the `javascript` subdirectory.

**smaz**  
https://github.com/antirez/smaz  
Did not perform well in our case because the data contained a lot of high-entropy hexadecimal characters which usually yielded negative compression.

**zlib/deflate**  
We saw about ~15% compression with deflate, hexcompress usually produced ~30% compression for our data.
